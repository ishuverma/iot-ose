= IoT OpenShift Example Project
===============

This example showcases an Intelligent Internet-of-Things (IoT) Gateway on https://www.openshift.com/container-platform/[Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform].  The Gateway enables real-time decision making at the edge, and demonstrates the ease with which you can deploy a secure and scalable microservices application on the enterprise-grade OpenShift application platform.

== Components

The application is deployed as a set of microservices inside containers on OpenShift:

- *https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-xpaas/version-0/red-hat-xpaas-fuse-integration-services-image/[JBoss Fuse Integration Services]* (FIS): Tools that facilitate integration, routing, and transformation of messages and protocols, by leveraging http://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel] technology.
- *https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-xpaas/0/paged/red-hat-xpaas-a-mq-image/[JBoss A-MQ]*: Apache ActiveMQ-based message broker container image for receiving and storing telemetry from the Sensor via http://mqtt.org/[MQTT]
- *https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-xpaas/0/paged/red-hat-xpaas-decision-server-image/chapter-1-introduction-to-the-decision-server-image/[JBoss BRMS Decision Server]*: Real-time execution of business rules for processing telemetry
- *https://zeppelin.apache.org/[Apache Zeppelin]*: Interactive data visualization and analytics
- *https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL]*: Provides persistence for sensor data
- *Simulated Software Sensor*: A simple Spring Boot application that simulates temperature, vibration, and GPS sensor data

== Prerequisites

* https://git-scm.com/[Git]
* https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[OpenShift command-line tools] for your platform
* Access to an OpenShift environment
* Two (2) available https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/dev_guide/persistent_volumes.html[Persistent Volumes]

== Setup

*Step 1:* Login to your OpenShift environment using the command-line tools

_Note: If you don't have an environment handy, the https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview/[Red Hat Container Development Kit] provides a fully-functional preconfigured OpenShift environment, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and JBoss, delivered as a Virtual Machine image. The VM should be enabled with minimum of 4 CPU and 6144MB memory (i.e. Vagrant file for CDK should be updated with this VM configuration)_

*Step 2:* Download the iot-ocp project in the OpenShift instance:

 $ git clone https://github.com/sabre1041/iot-ocp.git

*Step 3:* Execute the init script

 $ cd iot-ocp
 $ ./init.sh

The script automatically builds, deploys, and wires the necessary application components together.  Once the process is complete, you can see a graphical visualization of the application architecture using the OpenShift Web Console.

*Step 4:* Login to the OpenShift web console using a web browser

**Username**: admin

**Password**: admin

**Project**: iot-ocp

== Configure the Zeppelin visualization tool

The data visualization is stored in Notebooks. The interpreters allow Zeppelin to connect to PostgreSQL.

*Step 5:* Locate the *Zeppelin* service on the overview page and click on its url to launch the Zeppelin web console

*Step 6:* Under notebook, select **Import note** to import the pre-configured link:support/zeppelin/iot-ocp.json[iot-ocp notebook]

*Step 7:* Execute all visualizations by hitting the "Play" button on the top lefthand corner of the page next to the name of the note

*Step 8:* Periodically refresh the note data through cron scheduler

== Starting the Gateway

To bring the project back up, the components should be _started_ in the following order:

0. PostgreSQL
0. JBoss A-MQ
0. Kie
0. JBoss Fuse Integration Services (FIS)
0. Simulated Software Sensor
0. Apache Zeppelin
